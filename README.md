# Stock Screener
## Project Description
This Python-based stock screener uses web scraping to gather real-time financial data. It screens stocks based on customizable financial criteria, such as market capitalization and return on assets (ROA), and sends the results via email in an Excel file.

## Features
* Web scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
* Customizable stock selection criteria (e.g., market cap, P/E ratio).
* Headless browser for efficient scraping.
* Results sent via email as an Excel attachment.
* Randomized user-agent configuration to avoid detection during scraping.
